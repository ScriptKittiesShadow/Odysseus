                        <li><b>Summary Part #1</b> - While Odysseus traveled, his son and wife had problems of their own. Since he was gone for so long, people assumed that Odysseus was dead. Suitors attempted to marry Penelope, Odysseus's wife, but she and Telemachus, her son, didn't like this. However, the suitors wouldn't leave. Odysseus, at this time, was at an island called Ogygia and was cared for by a goddess named Calypso who kept him there. After years, Hermes came and told Calypso to let Odysseus leave. After leaving, he landed on the land of the Phaecians and met the princess. The princess took him to King Alcinuos, and Oddyseus told him about his crew's travels. After telling him about his meeting with the cyclops he talks about their journey to Aeaea. Circe, a witch who lives there, lets them stay there for a year. When they leave, Circe tells them that they need to find the ghost of Teiresias in the underworld to go back home.</li>

                        <li><b>Summary Part #2</b> - They found Teiresias by digging a trench and pouring blood into it so ghosts like Teiresias would be attracted. When he appears, Teiresias says to not kill the oxen of the Sun, but, no matter what, Odyesseus will still reach home. They pass through the island of Sirens, where they would have heard magical songs that attract anyone. To counter this, Odysseus's men put wax in their ears, but Odysseus tied himself up so he can still hear the Sirens without being attracted. When the crew finally reaches the sun oxen, his crew tries to eat the oxen behind Odyesseus' back. Due to this, the sun god killed the entire crew with only Odyesseus surviving. (pause) After hearing his story, King Alcinuos sends Odysseus back home. Athena tells Odyseus about the suitors and they come up with a plan and kill them all. Odysseus finally reunites with his family after 20 years.</li>
